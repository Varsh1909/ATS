# ATS (Applicant Tracking System) Application

## Project Overview

The ATS application is a React-based frontend with a Flask and Python backend, designed to rank candidates based on criteria such as skills and experience. It utilizes machine learning models (Random Forest) to classify and rank candidates for different job roles.

## File Structure Breakdown

### Root Directory
- `.gitignore`: Lists files and directories ignored by Git.
- `README.md`: Project documentation.
- `ats-backend-deployment.yaml` & `ats-frontend-deployment.yaml`: Deployment configurations for CI/CD pipelines.
- `docker-compose.yml`: Defines services for Docker Compose.

### Backend Directory
- `candidate_ranking.py`: Core logic for candidate ranking and Flask API.
- `ats-backend-service.yaml`: Backend service configuration.
- `Dockerfile.backend` & `Dockerfile.python`: Docker configurations for backend.
- CSV Files: `FinalResult.csv`, `job_skills.csv`, `skills_and_salaries_categories_p.csv`.
- `requirements.txt`: Python dependencies.
- `server.js` and `server1.js`: Node.js servers for Docker and CI/CD integration.

### Frontend Directory
- `src/`: React source code.
  - `App.js`: Main entry point.
  - `components/`: Reusable React components.
  - `pages/`: Application pages.
  - `api/`: Backend API interaction.
- `build/`, `public/`: Static files and built frontend.
- `ats-frontend-deployment.yaml`: Frontend deployment configuration.
- `Dockerfile`: Frontend Docker configuration.

## Backend

### Flask API Setup
The Python Flask API is responsible for:
- Loading CSV data (candidates, job roles).
- Training Random Forest models for candidate classification and salary prediction.
- Exposing a `/rank-candidates` endpoint for candidate ranking.

### How to Run the Backend

1. Set Up Python Environment:
   ```
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

2. Run the Flask App:
   ```
   python candidate_ranking.py
   ```
   The Flask app will start on port 5000.

3. API Endpoint:
   - POST `/rank-candidates`:
     - Input: JSON body with `requiredRole`, `topN`, and CSV file paths.
     - Output: Ranked candidates with skill match score and predicted salary.

4. Dockerization:
   ```
   docker build -f Dockerfile.python -t ats-backend .
   ```

5. Run Docker Container:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

## Frontend

### React Application Overview
The React frontend allows users to input job roles, specify the number of candidates to rank, and trigger the backend ranking process.

### Running the Frontend Locally

1. Install Dependencies:
   ```
   npm install
   ```

2. Start the React App:
   ```
   npm start
   ```
   The app will run on http://localhost:3000.

3. Dockerization:
   ```
   docker build -t ats-frontend .
   ```

4. Run Docker Container:
   ```
   docker-compose up
   ```

### API Integration
The frontend interacts with the Flask backend via the `/rank-candidates` API, sending job role and candidate number specifications and displaying the results.

## Conclusion

This ATS project combines a Flask backend using Random Forest models for candidate ranking with a React frontend for user interaction. The application is fully Dockerized for easy deployment and scalability.
